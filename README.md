# 🏓 Pong — The Ultimate Retro Battle!

## 🎮 Features That Will Make You Question Reality

- 🤖 **AI Opponent with Multiple Difficulties**  
  From "half-asleep potato" to "I see the Matrix" — challenge the AI that scales with your ego.

- 👾 **VS Mode (1v1 Local Multiplayer)**  
  Bring a friend, rival, or that cousin who says they're good at games. Destroy them.

- 🎮 **Dual Controller Support**  
  Two controllers? No problem. Who needs a keyboard anyway?

- 🔊 **Sound Effects**  
  Every paddle hit and game over is packed with juicy audio goodness.

- 🌩️ **Visual Effects (a.k.a. Juice!)**  
  Screen shakes, flashies, maybe even a tear in space-time when you score. Immersive, chaotic fun.

## 🧠 Why Did We Make This?

Because plain old Pong was just too... well, plain. We wanted something spicy, something with flair — and a few physics-defying bugs (features?).
